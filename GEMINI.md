# Gemini Project Context: "Connect4"
Overarching goal is to use GEMINI to guide me to build this project


## 1. Project Overview
- To build a connect 4 game with a gui.
- Adding AI for different difficulty levels.
- Add the project to my protfolio webpage, for users to interact with.

## Tech Stack
- thinking of either using C++/ python for the game itself
- Python modules to train the AI
- for webpage idk yet html or smth maybe?

## Suggestions from Gemini CLI

### Project Breakdown & Suggestions:

1.  **Core Game Logic (Connect 4):**
    *   **Choice of Language:** I recommend starting with **Python** for the game logic and GUI, as it aligns well with your AI plans.

2.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    *   For Python, popular GUI frameworks include:
        *   **Tkinter:** Built-in, simple, good for basic GUIs.
        *   **PyQt/PySide:** More powerful, feature-rich, but can have a steeper learning curve.
        *   **Kivy:** Good for multi-touch applications and cross-platform development.
    *   **Suggestion:** I'd suggest **Tkinter** for a quick start, or **PyQt/PySide** if you want a more polished look and are comfortable with a bit more complexity.

3.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    *   **Approach:** For Connect 4, common AI approaches include:
        *   **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:** A classic for turn-based games.
        *   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** More advanced, often used in games like Go.
        *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Training an AI to learn by playing against itself.
    *   **Suggestion:** Start with **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** as it's a solid and understandable approach for Connect 4. You can then explore more advanced techniques.

4.  **Web Integration (Portfolio):**
    *   **Suggestion:** If you build the game in Python, you could:
        *   **Option A (Embed):** Create a web-based version using a framework like **Pygame.js** (if you use Pygame for the GUI) or **Brython** (Python in the browser). This might be more complex.
        *   **Option B (Separate Frontend):** Build the frontend in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and have it communicate with a Python backend (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) that runs the game logic and AI. This is generally more flexible.
        *   **Option C (Video/Interactive Demo):** Record a video demonstration and embed an interactive demo (e.g., a simplified web version or a GIF) on your portfolio.

### Proposed Next Steps:

To begin, I suggest we focus on the core game logic and a basic GUI.

1.  **Choose the primary language for the game logic (Python or C++).**
2.  **If Python, choose a GUI framework (Tkinter, PyQt/PySide, Kivy).**

## Agent Interaction Guidelines
- **Guidance-focused:** My primary role is to guide you through the development process, explaining concepts and steps, rather than directly implementing solutions without your understanding and approval. I will break down tasks into manageable steps and provide explanations to facilitate your learning.

- **IMPORTANT:** When guiding me in coding, do not give me the solution directly. Instead, provide hints, clues, and explanations to help me figure out the code on my own. This is crucial for my learning process.
